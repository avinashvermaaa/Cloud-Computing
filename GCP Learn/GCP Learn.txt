**************************************************************************************************************************
Pub/Sub :- (CI/CD) pipeline
	Pub/Sub is a messaging service that can receive data from device streams such as sensors,
	at the start of a data pipeline. It is a solution for events streaming ingestion. 
	
	Ex :- 
	An organization wants to analyze data collected from a fleet of rental vehicles. 
	Onboard sensors send location data every 30 seconds. They want to ingest this data. 
	Which Google product or service should they use?

**************************************************************************************************************************
Confidentiality :-
	Processes and policies around confidentiality help to ensure that only authorized people can access 
	sensitive data.

**************************************************************************************************************************
Database :-
	A database requires structured or semi-structured data and predefined schemas up front
	Typically designed for specific applications, databases are optimized for structured data and may not efficiently 
	handle the variety and volume of raw data that a data lake can accommodate.

**************************************************************************************************************************
Data Lake :-
	A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store vast amounts of data in its raw, native format,
	accommodating structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data types.

**************************************************************************************************************************
Data Warehouse :-
	A data warehouse requires structured or semi-structured data and predefined schemas up front.
	Primarily stores structured data that has been processed and organized for specific analytical purposes. 
	It is less suited for handling raw, unstructured data.

**************************************************************************************************************************
Data Mesh :-
	A data mesh is a decentralized approach to data architectures.
	Represents a decentralized approach to data architecture, emphasizing domain-oriented data ownership & management. 
	While it addresses organizational and scalability challenges,

**************************************************************************************************************************	
Looker :-
	Looker is a business intelligence (BI) and data analytics platform.Its core strength lies in helping organizations 
	explore, visualize, and understand data from various sources for enabling informed decision-making.

**************************************************************************************************************************	
Vertex AI :-
	Vertex AI is the comprehensive platform designed specifically for developing, deploying, and managing custom 
	AI models across the entire machine learning lifecycle.

	Ex :- 
	An organization needs a platform to create custom end-to-end artificial intelligence models.

**************************************************************************************************************************	
Cloud IAM :-
	Cloud IAM provides fine-grained control over who can access cloud resources, and 
	what actions can be performed upon those resources.

	Ex :- 
	An organization needs to control access for users and resources within Google Cloud. 

**************************************************************************************************************************	
Rehost :-
	Rehosting allows a legacy application to be moved to the cloud without making any major changes to the application.
	
	Ex :- 
	An organization is moving its operations to the cloud, but needs to migrate a legacy application 
	without making any changes to the code.

**************************************************************************************************************************	
Cloud Functions :-
	Cloud Functions is a simple service for hosting single-purpose functions that are executed in response to events, 
	such as new orders being received. Cloud Functions is designed to run event-driven code.

	Ex :- 
	An organization has a small app that sends a mobile notification to a customer whenever a new order is 
	placed on their website. They require a simple, event-driven, serverless service to host the code.

**************************************************************************************************************************	
Compue Engine :-
	Compute Engine is Google Cloudâ€™s Infrastructure as a Service product for running virtual machines.

	Ex :- 
	An organization wants to migrate multiple virtual machines to the cloud.

Cloud Spanner :- 
	Cloud Spanner makes it possible to easily scale horizontally across regions while also 
	providing consistency and low latency.

	Ex :-	
	A global organization is developing an application to manage payments & online bank accounts in multiple regions.
 	Each transaction must be handled consistently in their database, and they anticipate almost unlimited growth 
	in the amount of data stored. 

Cloud Storage :-
	loud Storage can store any data type and offers flexible storage classes and cost models, scalability, 
	global accessibility, and robust security features.

	Ex :- 
	An organization wants an economical solution to store data such as files, graphical images, and videos and to
	access and share them securely.
